editor_description = "This game tests whether The student has become the master so it is impeative to check the function of this code to make sure it works and adheres to kacey's standard and make sure to chat with Christopher Tralie about teaching methods because his are socially and morally incorrect so it is important to understand why this code must exist to save the computer science department from funding cuts because Ursinus College is in debt due to overspending caused by budget cuts that were done by President Hannigan because she had fired Missy Bryant for overspending on the budget so in conclusion make sure to check this code for errors/bugs and check for specifc inquiries on this code, contact Daniel Espinal, daespinal@ursinus.edu, or you can reach him at Lyynwood Hall 102, 702 E Main St, Collegeville, PA, USA, North America, Western Hemisphere , Earth, Sector 3, dont be afraid to contact as I'm available in the hours of 10am-10pm Monday through Friday, 5 days a week for 60 weeks of the year, if you can't find me I could be playing frisbee so you can check on that field which is located at Ursinus College, Collegeville, PA, USA, Western Hemisphere, Earth,so now that you know who wrote this code it is important to note my professor la who does not like the code but still silently approves of it because he is  jealous that he couldn't save the CS department from budget cuts due t President Hannigan, so finally make sure you review this code in the coding handbook.gov or just contact me or whatever lulz, ok bye"
